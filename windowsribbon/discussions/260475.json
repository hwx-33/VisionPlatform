The template can be found here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC:\\Users\\&lt;Username&gt;\\AppData\\Local\\RibbonGenerator\\Template.bat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe there is something wrong with the link for the link.exe. You can modify the template file.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor testing you can do the following:<br>\r\n- Create a copy of template.bat file<br>\r\n- Replace all placeholders in your copy, <br>\r\n- Start Visual Studio Command Prompt and execute it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest regards,<br>\r\nBernhard",

The RibbonGenerator only replaces the place holders looking like {Placeholdername}.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another option:</p>\n<p>%VS100COMNTOOLS% is an environment variable of your system and can open a Command Prompt and execute \"SET\".
