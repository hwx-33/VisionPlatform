I'm not linked to this project nor to Microsoft in any way, so the following&nbsp;guidance may not be&nbsp;entirely accurate.</p>\r\n<p>Ribbon functionality from Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 was backported to Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, but not to earlier Windows versions. On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008,&nbsp;the Windows Ribbon and Animation Manager Library update (Microsoft <a title=\"KB960362: Description of Windows Ribbon and Animation Manager Library\" href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/960362/\">KB960362</a>)&nbsp;is required, which depends on Windows Vista/Server 2008 Service Pack 2. This update&nbsp;is part of the so called Platform Update for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, and it is being&nbsp;deployed through Automatic Updates, Microsoft Update, and Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), provided the Service Pack 2 is installed. So, in fact, applications based on the&nbsp;Ribbon Framework will not work with Windows versions earlier than Windows Vista.</p>\r\n<p>Regards.</p>",
