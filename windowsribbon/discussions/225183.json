A white area is placed between the ribbon and the form border:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.dabostudios.net/incorrect.png\">click</a></p>\r\n<p>If I instead use FormBorderStyle = Sizable the problem is gone: <a href=\"http://www.dabostudios.net/correct.png\">click</a></p>\r\n<p>If I use Windows 7 basic theme it doesn't matter what FormBorderStyle is set to, it always works. I am using the same code as in the tutorials (SplitContainer) and get the same result on two computers, how can I fix this?</p>",
