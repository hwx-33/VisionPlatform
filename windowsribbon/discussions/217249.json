    "Html": "Hello, Arik!\r\n\r\nI have some trouble using SplitButton in my application...\r\n\r\nThe situation is the following. I have a SplitButton that contains a list of types of the libraries (as Buttons). When the library is being loaded, I need this SplitButton to show, what type is this library of. For example, the default value of this SplitButton is &quot;Generic&quot; (the Button inside SplitButton), and if I load a library of type &quot;Music&quot;, I need it to &quot;select&quot; the needed Button.\r\n\r\nI don't know exactly what to do, but I think I need to call UpdateProperty for my SplitButton... And here's a problem: I don't know how to :)\r\n\r\nCould you help me, please?\r\n\r\nThanks.",
