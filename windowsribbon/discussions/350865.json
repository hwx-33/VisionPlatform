Since the current version of the ribbon framework doesn't feature dialog box launchers I need an extra button to open a character format dialog. It would be nice  to be able to put that next to a FontControl element.</p>\n<p>So far I haven't been able to manage this. No matter what I do (e. g. using a custom GroupSizeDefinition or not setting a group size definition at all) I get unhelpful errors concerning the SizeDefinition \"IntRichFont\" which seems to be an internal part  of the FontControl control.</p>",
