The value is set correctly when looking via the debugger, but the text area is not updated.</p>\r\n<p>I tried adding a call to _ribbon.Framework.InvalidateUICommand() in StringValuePropertiesProvider.StringValue and that did trigger theUpdateProperty method in the StringValuePropertiesProvider but again nothing was updated.</p>\r\n<p>Am I missing something, or is this a bug in the framework?&nbsp; As I see an example in the Windows Live Movie Maker working and this is kind of a show stopper if I can't get this to work..</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n",
