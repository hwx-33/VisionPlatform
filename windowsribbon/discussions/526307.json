When I convert the image and display it on the blue ribbon, it displays, but the plus sign is blue instead of white.\r<br />\n<br />\nI've tried opening my ping images in photoshop cs5 and placing them over a black colored layer and saving as a bitmap (32 bit), but when I try to use it on my ribbon, it compiles no problem, but simply doesn't show the image at all on the ribbon button.\r<br />\n<br />\nI've been using this ribbon for quite a long time, but previously I've been loading them like this:\r<br />\n_Button_AddItem.LargeImage = Ribbon1.ConvertToUIImage(My.Resources.add_icon) \r<br />\n' where &quot;add_icon&quot; is a transparent ping.  This displays on the ribbon perfectly.\r<br />\nAlthough this method allows me to use transparent ping images directly without converting them to bitmap, they occasionally don't load at all, and I get fully functional ribbon buttons, but no images on them.\r<br />\n<br />\nHow do I convert my transparent ping images and leave the white colored parts alone/leave the white parts white and not make white transparent/black too?\r<br />\n<br />\nPlease help...<br />\n",
