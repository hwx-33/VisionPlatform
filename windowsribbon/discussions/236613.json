I've browsed the discussions but didn't find any solution so here I go:</p>\r\n<p>I followed the tutorial; downloaded the SDK, built and installed the generator, built and added the ribbon.dll to my project (I even created a clean project for testing) but no matter what I end up with the following result in the RibbonGenerator.log file\r\n and an error within VS:</p>\r\n<p>2010-12-01 00:52:48 - uicc.exe failed to generate .bml or .rc file!RibbonGenerator.FaildException: uicc.exe failed to generate .bml or .rc file!&nbsp;&nbsp; at RibbonGenerator.Manager.ConvertXmlToDll(String localizedRibbonXmlFilename)&nbsp;&nbsp; at RibbonGenerator.Manager.CreateRibbon(Target\r\n element)</p>\r\n<p>I'm running on Win7 x64 with VS2010. Initially I tried targeting framework 4.0 but I also tried 3.5 and I've tried to compare my project with the sample projects but cannot find where I go wrong.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thx in advance<br>\r\n.h&aring;kan&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
