I think the Form implementation of .NET is doing something different here. Maybe the HandleCreated of the form and ribbon wrapper control  is done in separate window messages. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-autospace: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\nI'm sorry, I don't have a working fix for this at the moment.\n<p style=\"text-autospace: none;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n</div>",

(But then you can't click the ribbon... why is there always a catch??)<br />Is then an entirely diffferent way that the ribbon can be initialized?<br /></span></p>",
