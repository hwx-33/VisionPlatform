However, whenever I add the Ribbon to my form, I only get&nbsp;a white box with a line down the middle and a line across the middle. Whenever I try to compile\r\n the project, there is just a white space where the ribbon should be. I copied the XML file from one of the examples, but nothing has changed. Then I tried copying the Program.vb file. Again, no change. Any help?</p>\r\n",
