Once you focus another window, the window is redraw and the white bar dissapear. Also note that the form doesn't fill all the window, and a black bar (of the same size of the title bar appears at the bottom.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"http://img21.imageshack.us/img21/4725/errordp.png\" alt=Error><br><a href=\"http://img21.imageshack.us/i/errordp.png/\"></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you any any way to set some property related with that issue, maybe when the ribbon is created, that could help me solve this issue?</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Nico</p>",
