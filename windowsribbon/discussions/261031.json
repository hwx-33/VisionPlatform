I've done everything as stated in Bernhard's blog and I've got a problem.</p>\r\n<p>I've added the Ribbon.xml file and built the project, such that Ribbon.ribbon file appeared. However, when I try to set the ResourceName of ribbon to the generated file, IDE protests with a message:</p>\r\n<p>Ribbon resource 'wfSketchbook.Ribbon.ribbon' not found in assembly 'C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.Net\\assembly\\GAC_MSIL\\System.Windows.Forms\\v4.0_4.0.0.0__b77a5c561934e089\\System.Windows.Forms.dll'.</p>\r\n<p>Application's name is wfSketchbook and so is the program's namespace.</p>\r\n<p>However, if I edit the Form1.Designer.cs file, forcing the value property to &quot;wfSketchbook.Ribbon.ribbon&quot;, build and run the application, suprisingly it starts and displays the ribbon as expected. However, the form designer shouts with big error:</p>\r\n<p>http://www.spook.freshsite.pl/Temporary/ribbon-error.png</p>\r\n<p>I'm ok with fact, that the ribbon is not visible during designtime, but the constantly appearing error message is annoying.</p>\r\n<p>May I do something with that? Maybe I'm doing something wrong?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Best regards -- Spook.</p>\r\n",
