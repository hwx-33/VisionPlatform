The example works if the comboxes are places on the first/main tab which is viewed when the form is launched.</p>\r\n<p>If there are multiple tabs and the comboxes are placed on tabs other than the first one, the FillComboBoxes() routine throws a NullReferenceException. i.e. _comboBox1.ItemsSource is null. I believe tab objects are not initialized until they are viewed. Since the Ribbon Framework doesn't support Tab Click event, I don't know where to&nbsp;put the FillComboBoxes() to initiate the combox items when it's viewed.</p>\r\n<p>Can you help please?</p>\r\n<p>Regards<br>Ruan</p>",

The invalidation event is handled, and the property updates defined, by the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd371494(v=VS.85).aspx\">IUICommandHandler::UpdateProperty</a> callback method.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>IUICommandHandler::UpdateProperty</strong> callback method is not executed, and the application queried for an  updated property value, until the property is required by the framework.  For example, when a tab is activated and a control revealed in the  ribbon UI, or when a tooltip is displayed.</p>\r\n<div><strong> Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, a property can be retrieved through  the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd371370(v=VS.85).aspx\">IUIFramework::GetUICommandProperty</a> method and set with the   <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd371478(v=VS.85).aspx\">IUIFramework::SetUICommandProperty</a> method.&quot;</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>Which is accurate, i see the appropriate lists allocated once I change tabs.&nbsp; I've tried calling IUFramework::GetUICommandProperty but that returned with an E_FAIL.&nbsp; Is there some other way this should be handle to initialize the comobox correctly when not in the first tab?</div>",
