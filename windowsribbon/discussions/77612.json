But you CAN'T RUN it on XP! The Windows 7 Ribbon is a COM object which is NOT AVAILABLE under XP! It is not useless, you make wrong conlcusions about what a supported platform is. SDK can be installed on XP, bur Ribbon apps can't be run on XP.</p>\r\n<p>For more, check the WorkItems comments:</p>\r\n<p>http://windowsribbon.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=3710</p>",
